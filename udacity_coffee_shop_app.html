                <p>This case study was part of my UX design learning process through the Udacity Nanodegree design program. The problem statement was given at the end of the 3-month course and took 1 week to complete.</p>
                <ul><li>Deliverables: Wireframes, 13 UI Screens and Digital Prototype</li>
                    <li>Project Duration: 1 week</li></ul>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Udacity is considering opening a digitally-enabled coffee shop experience. As a part of this experience, students will be able to use an app, which exists separately from the Udacity classroom to perform actions such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Placing their drink orders</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with fellow classmates and students</li>
                    <li>Facilitating a productive study environment</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>For the secondary, I started by carrying out a competitive analysis to understand market needs and opportunities. Next, I went with conducting a public survey with 70+ responses.</p>
<p>As a part of primary research, I conducted semi-structured user interviews with 3 participants in online mode via zoom.</p>
                <h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*FMFI2LPXEmZNEMLVLHxJyQ.png">
                <p class="quote">Screenshots from Starbucks App</p>
                <p>To gather information and insights about the existing market and opportunities. I considered conducting a SWOT analysis for Starbucks and strategising accordingly.</p>
                <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong loyalty program</li>
                    <li>Reputed brand image</li>
                    <li>Packaging</li>
                    <li>Quality and Taste</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Weakness</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confusing user flow to order drinks</li>
                    <li>Account creation</li>
                    <li>Crash issues</li>
                    <li>Intimidating error</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Geographical expansion</li>
                    <li>Online payment</li>
                    <li>Cloud cafes</li>
                    <li>Bean subscription</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Threat</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Third-party delivery</li>
                    <li>Expensive coffee beans</li>
                    <li>COVID restrictions</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Public Surveys</h2>
                <p>I kept the survey question list very short to not move away from the scope of the problem and gather only relevant responses. Here are the questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What time of day do you usually drink coffee?</li>
                    <li>Where do you usually consume your drink?</li>
                    <li>Type of coffee preference?</li>
                    <li>How often do you consume coffee?</li>
                    <li>Which outlet do you prefer for your coffee?</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Insights Drawn</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>77% of people drink coffee before their first meal of the day.</li>
                    <li>21% of people are completely dependent on cafes to get their coffee.</li>
                    <li>84% of people like their coffee with some additives, rest like black coffee.</li>
                    <li>89% of people drink coffee on regular basis.</li>
                    <li>41% of the people prefer Starbucks, 12% prefer Jab, 8% prefer Dunkin and 39% to other outlets.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                <p>As mentioned, there were 3 participants over a zoom call whom I interviewed and asked a few probing questions as well to dig deep into their behavioural reasonings. Here are some questions from the questionnaire:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> What's your eating regime like in a day?</li>
                    <li> Which is your favourite cafe? followed by  Why?</li>
                    <li> When was the last time you visited a cafe?</li>
                    <li> How did you choose what to drink?</li>
                    <li> How did you order your drink?</li>
                    <li> What kind of instructions did you give while ordering?</li>
                    <li> What do you prefer between going to a cafe and ordering drinks online?</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Insights Drawn</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coffee is a major part of daily lifestyle</li>
                    <li>People choose cafes firstly depending upon the ambience and then the quality of the drink.</li>
                    <li>People choose their favourite drink or either order something which was suggested to them or something which is famous for a brewery when confused.</li>
                    <li>Personalisation with their drink is something which people value a lot.</li>
                    <li>People go to cafes to meet their friends and work in a vibrant environment.</li>
                    <li>Discounts or freebies are rare but they are exciting when given.</li>
                    <li>They get confused with the menu without drink description</li>
                    <li>Crowded cafes make the experience unpleasant.</li>
                </ul>
